# Shell Scripting Practice for AWS & DevSecOps

This repository contains my structured learning and hands-on practice in **shell scripting**, with a focus on **AWS automation**, **DevSecOps workflows**, and **secure scripting practices**.  
The goal is to build strong foundational skills and create practical scripts that demonstrate real-world automation capabilities.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository
- Develop proficiency in Bash and shell scripting  
- Build automation scripts commonly used in **cloud operations** and **DevSecOps pipelines**  
- Apply secure scripting best practices (`set -euo pipefail`, input validation, no hardcoded secrets)  
- Maintain a public learning archive to show professional growth  
- Strengthen GitHub usage for version control and project organization

---

## 🧰 Areas of Focus
- Bash fundamentals (variables, control flow, functions)  
- AWS CLI scripting for resource audits and automation  
- System monitoring and log analysis  
- Security and compliance checks  
- CI/CD and operational automation patterns
